                A Passion for Spaces That Feel Storied & Soulful
              </h2>
              <p className="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed mb-6">
                With a 20+ year design career spanning from the historic midwest
                to Portland, Oregon, Jody has developed an eye for spaces that
                feel storied and soulful. She leads a team known for their
                thoughtful approach and beautiful designs that are both inviting
                and inspiring.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Before moving to Portland in 2010, Jody lived across the country
                — from Southern California to Chicago — gaining inspiration from
                different regional design styles. Each place left its mark,
                shaping a design philosophy rooted in warmth, authenticity, and
                attention to detail.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In 2015, Jody founded Greylyn Wayne, turning her lifelong
                passion into a full-service interior design and home staging
                company. What started as a solo venture has grown into a
                family-run business serving homeowners, realtors, builders, and
                property managers throughout Oregon and Southwest Washington.
              </p>
              <p className="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed">
                A few years ago, Jody passed on the home staging side of the
                operation to her daughter and son-in-law, guiding them into
                their current roles while remaining a strong presence as the
                lead designer — dedicating the time and attention needed to
                craft beautiful, custom projects.

            &ldquo;Every space has a story. Our job is to tell it.&rdquo;
          </h2>
          <p className="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Jody&apos;s approach to design centers on understanding the
            character of each space and the people who inhabit it. She believes
            the best interiors feel both intentional and effortless — spaces
            that are beautiful to look at and genuinely comfortable to live in.
          </p>
          <p className="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed">
            This philosophy extends to home staging as well, where the goal
            isn&apos;t to create a showroom, but to help buyers feel an
            emotional connection — the unmistakable sense of coming home.
