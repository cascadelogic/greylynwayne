## Founder
**Jody Wallace** — Founder & Lead Designer
Jody has a 20+ year design career spanning from the historic midwest to Portland, Oregon. Before moving to Portland in 2010, she lived across the country — from Southern California to Chicago — gaining inspiration from different regional design styles. A few years ago, Jody passed on the home staging side of the operation to her daughter and her husband, working to guide them into their current roles while remaining a strong presence as the lead designer, dedicating the time and attention needed to craft beautiful, custom projects.
